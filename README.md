Twinalyzer is a SwiftUI app that scans your folders and groups **duplicate** and **look‑alike** photos—even when they’re resized, rotated, lightly edited, or named differently. It blends a **perceptual hash** for speed with **Apple Vision deep embeddings** for high‑quality similarity, then shows you crisp previews so you can keep only the best.
